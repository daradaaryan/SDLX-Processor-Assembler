# SDLX-Processor-Assembler
Computer Organization and Architecture (ES215) Course Project by Prof. Rajat Moona and Prof. Sameer Kulkarni.  
We have done the complete implementation of a RISC-V SDLX Processor using Verilog which runs on a BASYS-3 FPGA Board.  
The verilog contains a Top Module along with an ALU and a Register File. We have made it so that all types of functions (R type Triadic, R-I type Triadic and R-I type Dyadic instructions) can be used in it.  
We have also made an assembler which converts assembly language code to machine language code which makes it easier for the user.
